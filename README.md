# Number to LCD

## Part 1

Write a program that given a number (with arbitrary number of digits), converts it into LCD style numbers using the
following format:

```
    _  _     _  _  _  _  _  _ 
  | _| _||_||_ |_   ||_||_|| |
  ||_  _|  | _||_|  ||_| _||_|
```
(Representation with a space between digits)
```
     _   _       _   _   _   _   _   _ 
  |  _|  _| |_| |_  |_    | |_| |_| | |
  | |_   _|   |  _| |_|   | |_|  _| |_|
```

(each digit is 3 lines high and 3 chars wide)

Note: Please do NOT read the second part before completing the first. Part of the purpose of this kata is to make you
practice refactoring and adapting to changing requirements.

## Digits
The digits have a full size of 3x3.
